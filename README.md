## Problem Statement

Artificial intelligence can be used to assess the quality of student essays by applying NLP techniques to analyze coherence, clarity, and relevance. Topic modeling and sentiment analysis can determine main themes and emotional tone, while machine learning algorithms can be trained on high-quality essays to evaluate new ones. AI-based tools can offer feedback and suggestions to help students improve their writing skills, saving educators time and providing consistent evaluations.

## Deep Learning Models 

Transformers, LSTMs, GRUs, CNNs, and ML models can all be used to understand student behavior in education. Transformers analyze text data, LSTMs and GRUs model behavior over time, CNNs detect visual cues, and ML models identify factors contributing to academic success or failure. By combining these approaches, a comprehensive understanding of student behavior can be gained, allowing for tailored educational interventions to address individual needs.

## Metrics

Since this is a __regression__ problem, we consider metrics that take into account __continuous output variables__ and give their estimates based on the difference between the __actual output__ and __predicted output__. Below are some metrics that are used for this prediction.

* [__Mean Squared Error__](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.mean_squared_error.html)
* [__Mean Absolute Error__](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.mean_absolute_error.html)
