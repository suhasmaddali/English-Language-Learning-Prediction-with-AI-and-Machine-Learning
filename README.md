## Problem Statement

__Artificial intelligence__ can be used to assess the quality of student essays by applying NLP techniques to analyze coherence, clarity, and relevance. Topic modeling and sentiment analysis can determine main themes and emotional tone, while machine learning algorithms can be trained on **high-quality** essays to evaluate new ones. AI-based tools can offer feedback and suggestions to help students improve their writing skills, saving educators time and providing consistent evaluations.

## Deep Learning Models 

* Transformers, LSTMs, GRUs, CNNs, and ML models can all be used to assess the quality of student essays in education.
* Transformers analyze text data, LSTMs and GRUs model the coherence and relevance of the essay, CNNs detect visual cues in accompanying materials, and ML models identify factors contributing to effective writing.
* By combining these approaches, a comprehensive evaluation of the overall quality of a student essay can be achieved, allowing __educators__ to provide targeted feedback and improve student writing skills.

## Metrics

Since this is a __classification__ problem, we consider metrics that take into account __discrete output variables (scores)__ and give their estimates based on the difference between the __actual output__ and __predicted output__. Below are some metrics that are used for this prediction.

* [__Accuracy__](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.accuracy_score.html)
* [__Precision__](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.precision_score.html)
* [__Recall__](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.recall_score.html)
* [__F1 Score__](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.f1_score.html)
* [__Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK)__](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.cohen_kappa_score.html)

## Future Scope 
 
* It would a great idea to implement and use __GPT-2__ for extracting the text embeddings in the future before scoring the essays as this leads to good performance improvement. 
* Instead of fine-tuning transformer models, it is efficient to use the text-embeddings as the performance is quite similar to that of fine-tuning these models from scratch. 

## 👉 Directions to download the repository and run the notebook 

This is for the Washington Bike Demand Prediction repository. But the same steps could be followed for this repository. 

1. You'll have to download and install Git which could be used for cloning the repositories that are present. The link to download Git is https://git-scm.com/downloads.
 
&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Images/blob/main/Screenshot%20(14).png" width = "600"/>
 
2. Once "Git" is downloaded and installed, you'll have to right-click on the location where you would like to download this repository. I would like to store it in the "Git Folder" location. 

&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Images/blob/main/Screenshot%20(15).png" width = "600" />

3. If you have successfully installed Git, you'll get an option called "Gitbash Here" when you right-click on a particular location. 

&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Images/blob/main/Screenshot%20(16).png" width = "600" />


4. Once the Gitbash terminal opens, you'll need to write "Git clone" and then paste the link to the repository.
 
&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Images/blob/main/Screenshot%20(18).png" width = "600" />

5. The link to the repository can be found when you click on "Code" (Green button) and then, there would be an HTML link just below. Therefore, the command to download a particular repository should be "Git clone HTML" where the HTML is replaced by the link to this repository. 

&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Images/blob/main/Screenshot%20(17).png" width = "600" />

6. After successfully downloading the repository, there should be a folder with the name of the repository as can be seen below.

&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Images/blob/main/Screenshot%20(19).png" width = "600" />

7. Once the repository is downloaded, go to the start button and search for "Anaconda Prompt" if you have anaconda installed. 

&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Images/blob/main/Screenshot%20(20).png" width = "600" />

8. Later, open the Jupyter notebook by writing "Jupyter notebook" in the Anaconda prompt. 

&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Images/blob/main/Screenshot%20(21).png" width = "600" />

9. Now the following would open with a list of directories. 

&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Images/blob/main/Screenshot%20(22).png" width = "600" />

10. Search for the location where you have downloaded the repository. Be sure to open that folder. 

&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Images/blob/main/Screenshot%20(12).png" width = "600" />

11. You might now run the .ipynb files present in the repository to open the notebook and the python code present in it. 

&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/suhasmaddali/Images/blob/main/Screenshot%20(13).png" width = "600" />

That's it, you should be able to read the code now. Thanks.
